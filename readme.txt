This script is ran via python 3 in terminal. to get started type in the following commands

sudo apt update  
sudo apt install python3-pyshark 
sudo apt install pyshark

From there you might need to use either ipconfig or ifconfig to
check your network interface name (most common is either eth0 or eth1)

from there navigate to your folder and execute the mechagon.py file using

sudo python3 mechagon.py 


As of right now the script only works in linux baised enivronments.
